# Structured "Nonsense" Generator
This purpose of this project is to generate syntactically correct sentences with semantically incongruent words. 
As of v0.2 you can swap out nouns, verbs, and adjectives. However there is no code in place preventing nouns being swapped with plural nouns
or verbs being swapped with past tense verbs and other similar issues.
